# Quiz App

A simple quiz application built using Flutter and Dart. This app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and view their results at the end. It demonstrates core Flutter and Dart features like state management, private properties, getters, and arrow functions.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users can answer multiple-choice questions and select from provided options.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `StatefulWidget` to manage dynamic content like user inputs and quiz progress.
- **Private Properties**: Dart-specific feature using underscores (`_`) to make properties and methods private within a file.
- **Getters**: Methods that compute values based on class properties and can be accessed like variables.
- **Arrow Functions**: Simplified anonymous functions for concise code, especially when returning a value immediately.
